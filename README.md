# sandbox
Sandbox for the devs to familiarize in the team's github operation.

create 2 features:

    first feature: helloworld feature. 
    1. create new txt file. example: helloworlddaryle.txt
    2. type hello world in the document.

    3. send to repo.
    

    second feature: lorem ipsum feature.
    1. type any blurb in your existing document.
    2. send to repo.

    tips:


1. to keep your local repo updated, fetch and pull (if avail) before making new feature branch.
2. if you take some time after cloning or fetching before creating new branch, i recommend to fetch before creating new feature branch (incase theres new updates in the remote repo).

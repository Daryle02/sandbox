Sandbox for the devs to familiarize in the team's github operation.


***** Tasks ****

create 2 features:

    first feature: helloworld feature. naming example: helloworld_daryle

    second feature: lorem ipsum feature. naming example: loremipsum_daryle



branch naming convention:

example:  "feature/helloworld_daryle"

tips:

1. to keep your local repo updated, fetch and pull (if avail) before making new feature branch.
2. if you take some time after cloning or fetching before creating new branch, i recommend to fetch before creating new feature branch (incase theres new updates in the remote repo).
